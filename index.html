        <h2>Blossom Gaza – Reviving Our Dignity</h2>
        <p>
          After months of forced absence, Blossom Gaza is resuming its work on the ground for the first time since Amer’s 
          displacement last year. Stepping onto scarred soil and carrying a responsibility heavier than ever, our efforts now 
          continue through the work of Amer’s older brother, Abdullah Qudaih, filling us with purpose and renewed hope after a 
          long and exhausting pause.
          </br>
          </br>
          In the makeshift camps of west Khan Younis, where displacement has become an unthinkable 
          way of life, our people endure the infamous siege, unprecedented destruction, a shattered healthcare system, and a 
          relentless starvation strategy that grips every family by the lifeline.

        <h2>Genocide in Palestine: The Struggle for Survival</h2>
        <p>
          The term "genocide" is often used to describe the ongoing suffering faced by Palestinians as a result of years of 
          violence and systemic oppression. From forced displacement to daily bombardments and military raids, Palestinians have 
          endured unimaginable hardship. Gaza, in particular, has been described as an open-air prison, where nearly two million 
          people live under a brutal siege. With entire families wiped out in airstrikes and basic necessities like food, water, 
          and medical care in short supply, the toll on human life is staggering. While international law recognizes the rights 
          of the Palestinian people, the situation remains largely ignored by global powers, leaving Palestinians to fight not 
          only for their survival but for recognition as a people facing genocide.

        <h2>A Continuing Tragedy</h2>
        <p>
          The Israeli military's actions in Gaza and the West Bank, including airstrikes, blockades, and attacks on civilians, 
          have led to widespread death and suffering, particularly among children. Despite numerous international calls for peace 
          and justice, the cycle of violence persists, with little accountability for the perpetrators.
